# Hangman-Game

*Stranger Words* is a hangman-style game with a Stranger Things theme.

## Game Objective
The objective of the game is to guess the word by typing in letters on your keyboard. 

## Rules
The player starts out with 10 tries, and every incorrect letter guessed will decrease the "guesses remaining" count. 
If you succeed to guess the word correctly or use up all your tries, you will automatically get a new word. 
Every successfully completed word will increase your win count.

**Good luck, mouth-breather!** :grin:
